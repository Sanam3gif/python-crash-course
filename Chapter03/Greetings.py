# Exercises 3-2. Greetings:  Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name

name_Of_Friends = ['Hamid', "Qasim", "Abduallah", "Athar"]
print(f"You are my Best Friend Forever {name_Of_Friends[0].title()}")
print(f"You are my Best Friend Forever {name_Of_Friends[1].title()}")
print(f"You are my Best Friend Forever {name_Of_Friends[2].title()}")
print(f"You are my Best Friend Forever {name_Of_Friends[3].title()}")
